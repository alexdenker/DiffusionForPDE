# Infinite Dimensional Diffusion: Toy Example 

Learn a model for functions on a circular mesh. The functions have a zero background and contain a number of ellipses with varying intensity.  



### Installation

This implementation used the non-uniform FFT from *https://github.com/johertrich/simple_torch_NFFT*

It requires only PyTorch (>= 2.5 recommended) and NumPy and can be installed with
```
pip install git+https://github.com/johertrich/simple_torch_NFFT
```
